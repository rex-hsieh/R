This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. You are not expected to write this from the grounds up; this is created purely for demonstration purposes, so you can follow some of teh commands that you've been asked to do.

The following is a quick tutorial, should you ever want to use Markdown documents in the near future.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars, main="Distance vs Speed of Cars")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# The Basics

A copy of *Learning R* by Cotton (published by O'Reilly) is available in your Google Drive. I will follow its examples closely, while offering some methods that I found useful (and fairly efficient, of course).

**Assigning variables** is an important part of any languages; for historical reasons, I prefer using "<-" to assign variables, though "=" works just as well.


```{r}
x <- 1:5
y = 6:10
```
