# R


## This is a repository for novices to R. Written for PENCIL interns at NYU Wagner, FOHR, in the summer of 2018.

## These are based heavily on *Learning R*, published by O'Reilly. Real-life dataset examples are written by myself, focusing more on intuitive-based inferences instead of hard, scientific investigations.
